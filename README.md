-The Barangay Resident Information System is a digital platform managing resident and household records. Officials can efficiently add, update, and search profiles, categorizing residents by age. It secures data with validation rules and prevents duplicates. Ultimately, it streamlines population tracking and enhances record accuracy.

# Overview
The Barangay Resident Information System manages resident records by storing key details and categorizing residents as Child, Adult, or Senior. It allows adding, updating, deleting, and searching by name or house number, using encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to ensure organized, secure, and efficient data management.
